# Introduction

Intelie Live for Drilling is a software solution that analyzes drilling data in real-time to provide visualization, trigger alerts, calculate indicators and predict behaviors in order to improve safety, performance and collaboration.

The solution can collect data from sensors, system integrations, and user interactions.

Usually, there are basically two kinds of applications running: the Intelie Live, which is the main component of the solution, and several liverig-collector instances.&#x20;
