      * `import-export-service`
  * The following UI components were moved into the LiveRig plugin, and should not be used by other plugins. If you need any of them, please contact the responsible team for guidance.
    * `plugin-liverig/components/Highlight`
    * `plugin-liverig/hooks/useClickOutside`
    * `plugin-liverig/wits-custom-mapping/SuperSheet`

### New batch renormalization UI

The batch renormalization UI was updated to support the new normalization API.

The renormalization of time-series data typically will reprocess date-time information in order to create the normalized channels. However, for drilling applications, the plugins also need to deliver a renormalization by depth (see the [depth renormalization feature at Live Wells v5 series](wells-5.md#depth-support-for-batch-renormalizations)).

The renormalization now supports recalculating a single channel. Previously, at LiveRig v3 series, batch renormalization only could reprocess the entire dataset.

New feature flags to **use source timestamp** and **sort by source timestamp** were added.
