# Sources

Inside the `Sources` tab in the Intelie Live `Collectors` tab is possible to add sources for an online Collector with SSL enabled,  a button will be available at the bottom of sources list as shown below:

![List of sources configured for a Collector](<../../.gitbook/assets/collector-remote-control-sources.png>)

When clicking the `Create new source` button, there's a form that should be filled with sources information, like name, service company, protocol, mode, rig name and some store access information. The [protocols ](../protocols/)available are: WITSML (versions 1.3.1.1, 1.4.1.1 and 2.0), WITS, OPC-DA, OPC-UA, Modbus, CSV and RAW (JSON).

On the Access section, some protocols (example: WITSML and OPC) support the **Test Access** button to check the availability.

After saving the new source, you may wait for a while as the collector sources list is updated, then you can access more features for the created source by clicking on it's name.

On the source page, the **configurations** tab will allow you to update the configured event type and store access information, saving those changes may take a while to update as well.

Dependent upon the protocol type, additional tabs can be displayed. For example, sources for WITSML allow the configuration of [requests](https://drilling.intelie.com/collector/remote-control/sources/requests), [backlog sync](https://drilling.intelie.com/collector/remote-control/sources/backlog-sync) and [object explorer](https://drilling.intelie.com/collector/remote-control/sources/witsml-object-explorer).
