When selecting a WITSML source in client mode, is possible to manually set the requests that are being made to the server, through the `Requests` tab:

![WITSML Requests page showing a request already set up](<../../../.gitbook/assets/collector-remote-control-witsml-requests.png>)

Those changes made to a requests will be applied to the `sources.xml` file of the collector, specifically to the request tag of a source.

In this page is possible to create or edits requests, in a similar manner to how it's done through the collector's own page. When editing requests, every edited request will be marked with a yellow dot:

It's not possible to save two or more equal requests. When trying to save duplicated requests, a `Duplicated` tag will be shown on the duplicated requests at the sidebar, and a `THIS REQUEST IS DUPLICATED` tag will also appear at the request page. When clicking the icon, a list of every duplicated request is shown. Those requests listed can be clicked to view the request details:

It's also possible to delete WITSML requests when needed. To do so, select the request that should be deleted, and in the upper right corner a `DELETE REQUEST` button should be visible. After clicking it, a confirmation modal will appear asking for confirmation. After clicking the `Delete` button on the confirmation modal, the request will be imediatelly deleted. There is no need to click on the save after the confirmation:

After clicking the `Save` button or deleting a request, some time is needed before the collector apply the modifications in the remote site.
