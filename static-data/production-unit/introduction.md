# Introduction

To monitor the production and integrity of a well, the user must: 

1. Register a Production Unit
2. Associate the production channels with the Production Unit
3. Associate the well(s) with the production type intervention and its respective Production Unit
4. Register well production equipment using the Equipment Manager plugin.
5. Monitor the integrity and production of a well via dashboards and alarms

Attention! For a well to be associated with a Production Unit, it must be previously registered in the Wells plugin.

Attention! If an equipment archetype is already registered, item 4 is not necessary. 

In addition, to optimize the way equipment instances are installed, users can choose to fill in and upload a JSON file to Live. It should be noted that even though creating the instances is easier, the user needs to create all the archetypes used in the JSON one by one.
