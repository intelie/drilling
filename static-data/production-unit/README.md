# Production Unit

Monitoring the integrity of oil wells is an essential activity to guarantee the safety and efficiency of production. This monitoring is carried out using measurement and control systems installed on the surface, on the seabed and inside the well, which collect and transmit data on the operating conditions of the wells and equipment. This data is analyzed by specialized teams, who can identify and correct any problems or optimize production. Monitoring also involves carrying out periodic inspections and tests on the components of the production system to check their integrity and functionality.

The user flow and detailed user manual for the Well Production Monitoring (WPM) plugin are described on the next sections.
