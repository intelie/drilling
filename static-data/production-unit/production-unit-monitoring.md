# Production Unit Monitoring

Equipment structures are used to help monitor well production. They can be associated with one or more asset types, given the limits of each of their components and managed using the Equipment Manager plugin. To find out more about how to relate a production unit to a piece of equipment and how it can be used to monitor its integrity, visit the [monitoring-integrity-and-production-of-well](../equipment/monitoring-integrity-and-production-of-well/ "mention") page.

Complementing the monitoring by alerts coming from the equipment, we have the dashboards made for the production units which can be viewed on the[ production unit integrity page](../../features/dashboards/production-unit-integrity.md).
